Continued with my first react app from Day 24 and learnt the following

- refactored the code to include iteration over an array of booklist
- used the children argument to add include additional content to a component. these components are not captured in the property
- need to always include a key when using a map/list in react
- practised eventHandling.It's always better to pass functions to the events i.e onclick={()=>handleClick}
- learnt the difference between {named} and default export and used it to seprate the app into different files
- deployed my first website to netlify : https://booknotes.netlify.app/

Super pumped.

Time: 3:30hrs
