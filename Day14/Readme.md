Completed Revising the basic algorithm scripting course
- learnt the difference between for and for(in) loop. for(in) uses a string as the counter, while for loop uses an integer. for(in) loops over the properties of an object
- indexOf returns the position of an item in string or an array. It returns -1 if the element is not found.

Time- 3 hrs.

Started the OOP module
- Use instanceof to check if an object is an instance of a constructor
- Objects have 2 types of properties: ownProperty and prototype. Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. 
- A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.
- checked out declaring and accessing private variables in constructors for objects
- checked out immediately invoked functions (function name(){})(). The last set of brackets makes it immediately executable.
