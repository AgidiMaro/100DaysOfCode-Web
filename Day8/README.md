Started the Javascript algorithms and data structures course on freecodecamp and learnt the following
- Started the basic javascript script
    - use let instead of var to declare variables because it will prevent you from declaring a variable twice.
    - Javascript treats string like an immutable array of characters, so functions like length can work on strings.
    - saw the use of array.shift and array.unshift to add or remove the first item of an array as oppose to pop and push which focuses on the last item
    - return of a string can be assinged to a variable eg let variable = sum(x,y)
