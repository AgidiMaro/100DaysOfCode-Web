"#100DaysofCode-Web" 

I'm shamelessly starting web development from scratch again. For context, I've been in and out of programming since 2015. Dabbling from embedded systems to android development to data science.

For this repository, I will make a code commit every day for the next 100 days. I'll be starting with the freecodecamp certification. I want to practice front end and back end technologies. Wish me luck
