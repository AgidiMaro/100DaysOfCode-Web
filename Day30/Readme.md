Completed the Full React Course by John smilga on youtube (10 hours video that started from Day 24). On the last day, I learnt the following

- ReactRouter. Router is used to link pages. Link used to make navbar
- URLParams and placeholders
- React performance optimization
- React.memo
- useCallback
- useMemo
