Continued the basic javascript module of the Javascript algorithm and data structures course on Freecodecamp and learnt the following
- Type coercion is why JS will see 1=="1" as true.
- Strict equality (===) is the oppostie of the above. it checks both data type and value 1==="1" will yield false
- switch and case use strict
- wrote a program for counting cards using switch and ifs
- use dot notation for accessing properties without space in their name and bracket when there is space in the name of the object. object.name and object["name 1"]
- objects being key:value pairs can be used to replace the switch statment.
- hasOwnProperty(key) to check if an object has a key
- Return exits the function entirely, not just the for/if statement
- Started with recursive functions.- functions calling themself for n series
    - sum of n items in an array will be sum(arr,n-1)+ arr[n-1]
    - product of n items in an array will be prof(arr, n-1)*arr[n-1]
    - always remember to create base case (0 for addition and 1 for product)
- wrote a program for profile look up
