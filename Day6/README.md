completed the technical documentation page project of the freeecode responsive web design application.
- learnt to use the code tag
- learnt to use the overflow property for scroll of a fixed element in CSS

Time: 4hr

Spent 1hr reviewing flexbox again. 
- To make an element fixed with flexbox, you have to disable scrolling on the parent element with overflow: hidden
- Then you need to create a flex container with height equal to parent
- Add overflow: auto to the element you don't want fixed

Time : 5hrs
