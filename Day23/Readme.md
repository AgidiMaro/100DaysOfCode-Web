Continued and completed work on the react module and learnt the following
- lifecycle methods.
- componentDidMount() method of the lifecycle is a good place to setstate on API calls, track events
- Use && for a More Concise Conditional
-  If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. econd, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app

Started module on redux
- Redux is a state management framework 
- Redux methods include createStore(), getState()
- need to gain deeper understanding of react
