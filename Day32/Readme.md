conclude the react and redux module in freecode camp

Took a break on front end development to focus on the back end development for mtaji.

completed npm module and learnt the following

- the package.json file is where we set all the parameteres like author, name of the project, version
- naming convention for version/package in npm is "package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
- use ~ to include the latest patch eg. ~2.10.9, use ^ for latest minor version

Time : 3 hrs
