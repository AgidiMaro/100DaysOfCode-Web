continued work on the cash register 
- I used a nested iteration to check the cash register, use the UNIT_AMOUNT library to subtract the available change, update the cash register amount for each denomination, and correctly calculate the change amount to the correct decimal point position. Prior to dispensing the change, I made sure that the change array had the correct amount to give.
- encountered the use of regex101
    - use () to group a portion of the regex
    - use ? to indicate optiona;
- wrote algorithm to compute smallest common multiple. checked if numOfDivisors== divisorCount
- Completed the flatten a nested array challenge using the Array.isArray to check if item is an array. Then use recursion 
- used parseInt(char, 2) to convert binary string to integer. and String.fromCharCode to convert integer to char
- use arguments to get n/unknown arguments passed to a function
