Continued work on the intermediate algorithm scripting
- Completed the drop it algorithm - Given the array arr, iterate through and remove each element starting from the first element (the 0 index) until the function func returns true when the iterated element is passed through it. 
    - Learnt not to check if a function()==true, if the function already contains a return statements that evaluates to true or false
-learnt the combination algoritm for arrays
- stucked on the cash register algorithm
