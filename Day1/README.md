#Day 1
Starting with the Responsive Web Design Certification on freecodecamp

- Completed the basic HTML and HTML5 module in about 2 hrs. Refreshed knowledge of radio and check buttons, and other HTML elements.
- Completed the basic CSS module. Refreshed knowledge on border-radius:50% being a circle. 
    - An element can have multiple class using class="class1 class2"
    - The order of the class declarations in the <style> section  is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first.
    - Create variables in CSS using --variable_name and applied using var(--variable_name)
    - Use of fallback values to account for browser compatitibilty issue. For instance IE does not suppor CSS variables eg. var(-variable_name, red)
