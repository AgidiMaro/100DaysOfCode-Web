Concluded work on the basic javascript module on freecodecamp
- checked the use of ternary operator a?b:c for multiple conditions; 
- reviewed recursive function
- arr.push and arr.unshift showed me pepper. unshift and push adds to the array, unshifts adds at the start while push adds at the end. Their opposite is shift and pop 
- wrote a recursive function that outputted an array of integegers within a range (startNum and endNum)

Time - 2 hours

Did a mini research on MEAN and MERN.
Started the ES6 module of JS algorithm and data structure course
- Learnt to use the arrow function to declare and assign funtion to a variabe 
    const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
} or

const myFunction = () => "value;
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
- If an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses enclosing the parameter may be omitted.
const doubler = item => item * 2;
- learnt how to set default parameters in functions const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;
- with the rest parameter, create functions with vaiable number of arguments. function(... args) 
- need to reread rest parameter (...args) and spread operation (...)
- the spread operator (...) is used to expand arrays. For example
    const arr1 = [1,3,5,6,7];
    let arr2 = [..arr1]; // copies the content of arr1 into arr2.
- tried some basic algorithms
